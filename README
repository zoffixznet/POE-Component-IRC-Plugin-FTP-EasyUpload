POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-FTP-EasyUpload

DESCRIPTION

Being a bot herder as I am I often needed to upload some file there
somewhere and post a link to IRC so other users could grab the file...
So here it is, FTP uploading plugin which watches for special "tags" in
the outgoing messages which tell it to upload certain file.

B<Note:> uploading is done in a B<non-blocking> way, keep that in mind
in case you'd want to send some messages in a certain sequence.

HOW DOES IT WORK

Process is simple. Your "tag" is a regex with one to three capturing
parentheses (see C<tag> argument to constructor). Based on those captures
the specified file will be uploaded to a specified directory and the
"tag" will be replaced by the URI pointing to that file. After all that
message will be sent where it was supposed to go.

The plugin watches for "tags" in C<privmsg> and C<notice> message.
